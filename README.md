## 📚 A little about me

I started studying **Computer Engineering** — life happened, I took another path. But one thing never changed: my love for writing code and understanding how things work under the hood.

Even if not every project makes it to GitHub, I’m always tinkering, learning, and building weird little things for fun. I’m a firm believer that messing around is one of the best ways to learn.

## 🛠️ Stuff I Know

- 🐍 **Python** (my go-to)
- 🦀 **A bit of Rust**
- 📝 **Some C knowledge**
- 🌐 **Flask** (more comfy here) and a bit of **Django**
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** (dabbling)

## 🎥 Inspirations

I follow a lot of programmers on **YouTube** — their projects, ideas, and weird experiments keep me inspired and hungry to learn more. I love seeing how people break the rules, bend the tools, and make things their own.

## 🚀 What I'm About

I’m not chasing perfection or followers — I just genuinely enjoy writing code, breaking stuff, fixing it, and learning along the way.  
Even unfinished projects or random experiments teach me something new.

If you’re like me — a curious, hobbyist programmer, building for the fun of it — you’re more than welcome here.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

Feel free to check out my repos, ideas, or drop by to say hi. I’m always up for talking about code, weird ideas, or things people aren’t “supposed” to build.

**Thanks for reading — and keep building!**
